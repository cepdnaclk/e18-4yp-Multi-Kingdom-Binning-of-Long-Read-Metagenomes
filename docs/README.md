Microorganisms thrive in a multitude of environments worldwide, fulfilling critical roles in human health, agriculture, food production, climate regulation, and numerous other processes. Every living organism consists of tiny units known as cells, serving dual functions of providing structure and facilitating various biological processes. Enclosed within the nucleus of each cell lies the genome, a comprehensive blueprint encompassing instructions for the construction and sustenance of the entire organism, including its distinct characteristics and behaviors. This genetic blueprint resides within slender, thread-like structures called chromosomes, composed of DNA and proteins. DNA, the carrier of genetic information, adopts a double helix structure comprising two intertwined strands. Comprised of nucleotides, each denoted by specific letters—A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine), or T (Thymine)—DNA serves as the foundation for genetic coding. Genes, the fundamental units of heredity, constitute segments of DNA containing instructions for synthesizing proteins or functional RNA molecules. Serving as conduits of hereditary information, genes perpetuate traits across generations, thereby ensuring the perpetuation of life.
